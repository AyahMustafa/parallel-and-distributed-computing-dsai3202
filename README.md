Questions:
1) How does the execution time change when moving from sequential to
threaded to multiprocessing implementations?
Execution time decreases from sequential to threaded execution, but multiprocessing offers the greatest reduction by enabling true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.
2) Compute the performance metrics for the threaded and
multiprocessing executions.
Process-based execution time: 13.999131202697754
Multiprocessing execution time: 23.108370304107666
